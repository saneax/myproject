### Hello there

  This is my fist blog on a
  [pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html)  
  static site generator  

#### Setup 
  
  My Setup is a cubietruck (A20 SoC) board wth 2G RAM serving
  this page. The dynamic dns IP address is felicitated by [noip.com](http://noip.com)  
  
  The whole setup is on a cubietruck, and I am running pelican under a nginx server.

#### About Me
  So far so good, that is my hardware setup. I am a Quality Software Engineer, working at Red Hat  
  I work on the OpenStack project on mostly network function virtualization (NFV)  

  I am father to 3 boys and husband to a beautiful wife. I live in Delhi, India.

  I like to think of myself as a simple person, but obviously I am not that simple. I love
  to read and write and hopefully I will start blogging, which I have often thought to start.

#### Final Words
  Hello World!
